<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am an ETH Postdoc Fellow in the <a class="a-text-ext" href="http://ait.inf.ethz.ch" target="_blank">Advanced Interactive Technologies lab</a> at ETH Zurich. 
  I completed my PhD in the Computer Graphics group at TU Berlin, advised by <a class="a-text-ext" href="http://www.cg.tu-berlin.de/team/prof-dr-marc-alexa/" target="_blank">Marc Alexa</a>. 
  In 2020, I visited MIT working in the Computational Perception & Cognition Group led by <a class="a-text-ext" href="http://olivalab.mit.edu/audeoliva.html" target="_blank">Aude Oliva</a>. 
  Later that year I interned at Adobe Research working with <a class="a-text-ext" href="https://research.adobe.com/person/zoya-bylinskii/" target="_blank">Zoya Bylinskii</a> and 
  <a class="a-text-ext" href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hertzman/" target="_blank">Aaron Hertzmann</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My research interests fall at the intersection of human perception, computer vision &amp; graphics, and human-computer interaction.
  My goal is to <b>bring human common sense and behavior patterns into machine learning</b>.
  During my Ph.D., I have studied how humans perceive 3D shapes and what we can tell about people's mental imagery through observations of their eye movements.
  My current research interests are <b>vision-language multimodal learning</b>, with a focus on understanding <b>how humans' intent drives their actions and their interactions with the surroundings</b>.
  I am excited about learning from human perception and using what we learned in computational models and applications.
</p>

<h2>RA position</h2>
      <p>
        I am looking for research assistances to help develop research projects in direction of intent modeling
        (e.g. <a href=" https://sirop.org/app/f4d1fc84-0ddd-4c6d-9120-70a082628e81?_k=kziXUmj5seAjN2bJ" class="a-text-ext"> https://sirop.org/app/f4d1fc84-0ddd-4c6d-9120-70a082628e81?_k=kziXUmj5seAjN2bJ</a>) and interaction reconstruction
        (e.g. <a href="https://sirop.org/app/3518cd3d-22ab-4956-8fba-0b9a325a0a1d?_k=MfDB3aaWyD2IAS5J/" class="a-text-ext">https://sirop.org/app/3518cd3d-22ab-4956-8fba-0b9a325a0a1d?_k=MfDB3aaWyD2IAS5J</a>).
        Interested students should have a background in computer vision and deep learning, and have a working knowledge of available learning frameworks.
        The projects are highly research-oriented, and we encourage motivated students who are interested in gaining more research experience and publications to directly contact me via email.
        Excellent outcomes can easily result in a publication in top-tire venues.
