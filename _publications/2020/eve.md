Overview of the FAZE framework. Given a set of training images with ground-truth gaze direction information, we first learn a latent feature representation, which is tailored specifically for the task of gaze estimation. Given the features, we then learn an adaptable gaze estimation network, AdaGEN, using meta-learning which can be adapted easily to a robust person-specific gaze estimation network (PS-GEN) with very little calibration data.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p align="justify">
Estimating eye-gaze from images alone is a challenging task,in large parts due to un-observable person-specific factors. Achieving high accuracy typically requires labeled data from test users which may not be attainable in real applications. We observe that there exists a strong relationship between what users are looking at and the appearance of the user’s eyes. In response to this understanding, we propose a novel dataset and accompanying method which aims to explicitly learn these semantic and temporal relationships. Our video dataset consists of time-synchronized screen recordings, user-facing camera views, and eye gaze data, which allows for new benchmarks in temporal gaze tracking as well as label-free refinement of gaze. Importantly, we demonstrate that the fusion of information from visual stimuli as well as eye images can lead towards achieving performance similar to literature-reported figures acquired through supervised personalization. Our final method yields significant performance improvements on our proposed EVE dataset, with up to 28% improvement in Point-of-Gaze estimates (resulting in 2.49 degrees in angular error), paving the path towards high-accuracy screen-based eye tracking purely from webcam sensors.
